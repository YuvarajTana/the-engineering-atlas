# Understanding How AI Models Work

---

## 1. Basic Concepts

### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
- **Definition:** AI systems perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence (e.g., speech recognition, decision-making).
- **Examples:** Siri, Netflix recommendations, autonomous vehicles.

### What is Machine Learning (ML)?
- **Definition:** ML algorithms learn from data without explicit programming, identifying patterns to predict or decide.

### Types of Machine Learning
- **Supervised Learning:** Uses labeled data for training.
  - Examples: Spam detection, price predictions.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Finds patterns without labels.
  - Examples: Customer segmentation, dimensionality reduction.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learns through rewards and penalties.
  - Examples: Chess-playing AI, robotics.

## 2. How Models Learn

### Training Process
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, handling missing data, splitting (training, validation, test).
- **Feature Extraction:** Transforming raw data into meaningful inputs.
- **Model Optimization:** Minimizing errors using algorithms like Gradient Descent.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy:** Correct predictions percentage.
- **Precision:** Correct positive predictions proportion.
- **Recall:** Actual positives correctly identified proportion.
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Error Measurement:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## 3. Language Models Specifics

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) Basics
- **Definition:** Enables computers to understand and generate human language.
- **Tasks:** Sentiment analysis, translation, summarization.

### Traditional NLP Models
- **N-grams:** Predicts next word based on previous words.
  - Limitation: Short context.
- **Markov Chains:** Predicts next state based only on current state.
  - Limitation: Short-term memory.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Handles sequences, maintains state.
  - Limitation: Difficulty capturing long-range context.
  - Variants: LSTM, GRU.

## 4. Transformer Architecture

### Core Concepts
- Introduced by Vaswani et al. ("Attention is All You Need," 2017).
- **Self-Attention:** Weighs words dynamically.
- **Multi-Head Attention:** Multiple attention layers capture diverse context.
- **Positional Encoding:** Sequence ordering information.

### Why Transformers Outperform Older Models
- **Parallelization:** Enables efficient GPU use.
- **Context Capture:** Effective long-range dependency handling.
- **Scalability:** Handles complex data efficiently.

## 5. Large Language Models (LLMs) at Scale

### Scaling Components
- **Data:** Large datasets (web text, books).
- **Parameters:** Billions (e.g., GPT-3 with 175B parameters).
- **Computation:** GPU/TPU distributed training.

### Capabilities Unlocked
- **Few-shot/Zero-shot Learning:** Generalize quickly to new tasks.
- **Emergent Capabilities:** Complex reasoning, creativity, multilingual skills.

### Prominent LLMs
- **GPT series:** GPT-3.5, GPT-4.
- **ChatGPT:** Fine-tuned conversational model with RLHF.
- **Others:** Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, Anthropic's Claude.

### Training Methodologies
- **Pre-training:** Massive unsupervised training.
- **Fine-tuning:** Task-specific adjustments.
- **RLHF:** Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.
