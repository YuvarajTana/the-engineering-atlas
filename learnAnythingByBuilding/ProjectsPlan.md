# Software Development Training Plan

## Overview
This training plan introduces fresh graduates to software development by building three applications of increasing complexity. Each phase covers front-end, back-end, database integration, and, in the second phase, an AI model.

## Phase 1: Basic Application (To-Do App)

### Front End
- **Tech Stack**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Focus**: Basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and REST API calls.

### Back End
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express
- **Focus**: Creating a simple REST API for CRUD operations.

### Database
- **Tech Stack**: In-memory storage or file-based storage (JSON)
- **Focus**: Basic data persistence.

## Phase 2: Intermediate Application (Blog/Notes App)

### Front End
- **Tech Stack**: React
- **Focus**: Component-based architecture, state management, and routing.

### Back End
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express
- **Focus**: User authentication (JWT), structured data storage.

### Database
- **Tech Stack**: MongoDB or MySQL
- **Focus**: Handling user data and posts.

## Phase 2.5: Intermediate AI Application (Sentiment Analysis App)

### Front End
- **Tech Stack**: React
- **Focus**: User input for text and displaying sentiment scores.

### Back End
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express
- **Focus**: Integrating with a cloud-based AI service for sentiment analysis.

### AI Model
- **Service**: AWS Comprehend, Google Cloud Natural Language API, or TensorFlow.js
- **Focus**: Analyzing the sentiment of user input text.

### Database
- **Tech Stack**: MongoDB or MySQL
- **Focus**: Storing text and sentiment scores for future reference.

## Phase 3: Advanced Application (E-commerce/Booking System)

### Front End
- **Tech Stack**: React with state management libraries (Redux or Context API), TypeScript
- **Focus**: Advanced front-end concepts, type safety, and complex user interfaces.

### Back End
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express (potentially microservices architecture)
- **Focus**: Building a robust back end with multiple services and integrating third-party APIs.

### Database
- **Tech Stack**: MySQL
- **Focus**: Advanced database concepts like transactions, joins, and complex queries.
