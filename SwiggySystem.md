## 1. Functional Requirements

1. **User Onboarding & Profiles**  
   - Users can register, log in, maintain addresses.  
   - Delivery executives (riders) also have separate onboarding.  
   - Restaurants must register their outlet details and upload menus.

2. **Search & Discovery**  
   - Users can see a list of restaurants (potentially filtered by cuisine, location, rating).  
   - Restaurant details include menu items, prices, ratings, and open/close timings.

3. **Placing Orders**  
   - Users add items to a cart, confirm an order, choose a payment method, and place the order.

4. **Payments**  
   - Support for multiple payment modes: credit/debit cards, wallets, UPI, net banking, cash on delivery, etc.

5. **Order Management**  
   - Once the user places an order:  
     1. Restaurant receives the order request.  
     2. Restaurant confirms the order.  
     3. Delivery executive is assigned.  
     4. Executive picks up the order and updates the status in real-time.

6. **Real-Time Tracking**  
   - Users can track order status:  
     - Order placed → Accepted → Being prepared → Picked up → Out for delivery → Delivered.

7. **Notifications**  
   - Push notifications (mobile app) or SMS/Email for order status updates, promotional offers, etc.

8. **Reviews & Ratings**  
   - Users can rate both the restaurant and the delivery experience.  

9. **Customer Support**  
   - Users can chat or call support for refunds, complaints, or delivery issues.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability**  
   - Handle millions of users across multiple regions.  
   - Accommodate peak load (e.g., lunch or dinner times) gracefully.

2. **High Availability & Reliability**  
   - The system must be available 24/7, with minimal downtime.  
   - Fault-tolerant and resilient to component failures.

3. **Low Latency**  
   - Quick response for searching restaurants and placing orders.

4. **Performance**  
   - The user interface should feel snappy, even under heavy load.  
   - Quick order processing for restaurants.

5. **Security & Compliance**  
   - Payment data must be PCI-DSS compliant.  
   - Secure handling of user personal data.

6. **Observability**  
   - Logging, monitoring, and alerting (e.g., real-time dashboards, error alerts).

7. **Maintainability**  
   - The system should be easy to update, debug, and modify as the product evolves.

## 3. System Architecture Overview

At a high level, you can think of three main layers:

1. **Front-End** (Mobile App, Web App)  
   - **Mobile App**: Android/iOS apps for customers, a separate app for delivery executives, and potentially a web or tablet interface for restaurant owners.  
   - **Web App**: Browser-based interface for users who prefer to order via desktop and for admin dashboards.

2. **Backend Services** (Microservices)  
   - Each major functionality (e.g., orders, payments, search) can be decoupled into its own service for modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

3. **Data & Storage Layer**  
   - Various databases (SQL or NoSQL) to store user info, orders, and real-time location data.  
   - Caches (Redis) to quickly retrieve frequently accessed data (e.g., restaurant menus).

A simplified flow might look like this:

```
[Mobile/Web App] --(HTTPS)--> [API Gateway/Load Balancer] --> [Microservices]
                                                    |--> [Databases]
                                                    |--> [Cache]
                                                    |--> [Message Queue]
                                                    |--> [External APIs (Payment Gateway)]
```

## 4. Major Microservices & Responsibilities

1. **User Service**  
   - Manages user profiles (registration, login, addresses).  
   - Stores basic user data in a relational database.

2. **Restaurant Service**  
   - Manages restaurant onboarding, listing, and menu updates.  
   - Menu caching can be used to reduce load on the main database.

3. **Search Service**  
   - Provides restaurant and item search capabilities.  
   - Might use an indexing engine (like ElasticSearch) for full-text search and quick lookups.

4. **Order Service**  
   - Coordinates order placement, status, payment verification, etc.  
   - Responsible for persisting order details and orchestrating events (e.g., send order to restaurant, assign driver).

5. **Payment Service**  
   - Manages all payment integrations.  
   - Handles transaction workflows and ensures PCI-DSS compliance.  
   - Issues refunds where necessary.

6. **Delivery/Logistics Service**  
   - Manages delivery executives (riders), dispatching, route optimization, and real-time location updates.  
   - Could use geospatial databases or services for quick nearest-driver assignments.

7. **Notification Service**  
   - Sends push notifications, SMS, or email updates to customers, drivers, and restaurants.  
   - Could integrate with third-party push notification services (Firebase, SNS, etc.).

8. **Analytics Service**  
   - Aggregates data for reporting, dashboards, and business intelligence.  
   - Could be an asynchronous consumer of order/delivery events from a message queue.

## 5. Database Schema & Data Modeling

### 5.1 Core Tables/Collections

1. **Users Table**  
   - `user_id` (PK)  
   - `name`, `email`, `phone_number`  
   - `address(es)` (can be a separate table or a JSON column)  
   - Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

2. **Restaurants Table**  
   - `restaurant_id` (PK)  
   - `name`, `location`, `rating`, `cuisines` (tags)  
   - `owner_id` or contact info  
   - Timestamps

3. **Menu Items** (could be separate or embedded if using NoSQL)  
   - `item_id` (PK)  
   - `restaurant_id` (FK)  
   - `name`, `price`, `category`, `availability`, `rating`  
   - Timestamps

4. **Orders Table**  
   - `order_id` (PK)  
   - `user_id` (FK), `restaurant_id` (FK)  
   - `status` (e.g., PLACED, ACCEPTED, PREPARING, DISPATCHED, DELIVERED)  
   - `total_amount`, `payment_status`, `order_items` (could be a separate table or JSON)  
   - Timestamps

5. **Delivery Table** (or part of Orders, if combined)  
   - `delivery_id` (PK)  
   - `order_id` (FK)  
   - `delivery_executive_id` (FK)  
   - `pickup_time`, `delivery_time`, `status`  
   - Timestamps

6. **Payments Table**  
   - `payment_id` (PK)  
   - `order_id` (FK)  
   - `amount`, `payment_mode` (card, wallet, UPI), `transaction_id`  
   - `status` (SUCCESS, FAILURE, REFUND_INITIATED)  
   - Timestamps

7. **Ratings/Reviews Table**  
   - `review_id` (PK)  
   - `user_id`, `restaurant_id` (possibly `delivery_executive_id` if rating riders)  
   - `rating_value`, `review_text`  
   - Timestamps

### 5.2 Additional Data Stores

- **Redis** for caching restaurant menus, item availability, user session tokens.  
- **ElasticSearch or Solr** for fast text-based search and indexing of restaurants and menu items.  
- **Time-Series Database** (e.g., InfluxDB) for capturing metrics like orders per minute, response times.

---

## 6. Scalability Considerations

### 6.1 Load Balancing

- **API Gateway / Load Balancer**: Distribute requests across multiple instances of each microservice.  
  - **HAProxy, Nginx, or AWS ELB** (Application Load Balancer) can handle Layer 7 load balancing.  
  - Ensure sessions are stateless (use tokens) so any instance can handle user requests.

### 6.2 Microservices Horizontal Scaling

- Each service can be scaled independently based on CPU/memory utilization.  
- Container orchestration platforms like **Kubernetes** or **Docker Swarm** can automate scaling.

### 6.3 Asynchronous Communication

- **Message Queue** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for event-driven flows:
  - Order events (order_placed, order_accepted, order_cancelled).  
  - Payment confirmations.  
  - Real-time updates for analytics or notifications.

- **Benefits**: Decouples services, improves resilience, handles spikes gracefully.

### 6.4 Caching Strategy

1. **Menu Caching**: Restaurant and menu data are read-intensive, so caching can drastically improve performance.  
2. **Session Caching**: Store user session tokens, authentication states in Redis.  
3. **Geo-Location Data**: Possibly maintain a fast in-memory structure to quickly query nearest riders or restaurants.

### 6.5 Database Scaling

1. **Sharding/Partitioning**: Large relational tables might need sharding by geography or user ID.  
2. **Read Replicas**: Offload read traffic to replicas for heavy search queries.  
3. **NoSQL for High Velocity**: Consider a NoSQL store (like Cassandra or MongoDB) for real-time location updates and ephemeral data.

### 6.6 Real-Time Updates (Delivery Tracking)

- Use **WebSockets** (or Socket.io) to push order status changes and live location to the user’s mobile app.  
- Delivery executives’ apps continuously send location updates to a **Location Service** that can publish updates to the Order Service or a real-time tracking feed.

## 7. Infrastructure & Deployment

### 7.1 Environments

- **Development**: Local machine or small VMs.  
- **Staging**: For integration testing and QA.  
- **Production**: Scaled environment with high availability across multiple data centers/regions.

### 7.2 Containerization & Orchestration

- **Docker**: Package each microservice with its dependencies.  
- **Kubernetes**: For deploying pods and maintaining desired state, auto-scaling, rolling updates.

### 7.3 CI/CD Pipeline

- Automated builds and tests on every code push (using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.).  
- **Automated Deployments**: Blue-green or canary deployments to minimize downtime and risks.

### 7.4 Logging & Monitoring

- **Centralized Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk for aggregated logs.  
- **Metrics**: Prometheus/Grafana for service metrics (CPU, memory, request counts, latencies).  
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger, Zipkin to trace requests across multiple microservices.

### 7.5 Security & Compliance

- **HTTPS Everywhere**: Encrypt all traffic using TLS.  
- **Access Controls**: OAuth2 or JWT for authenticating and authorizing API requests.  
- **Payment Security**: Tokenize card information; do not store sensitive data unless absolutely needed (and then only encrypted).  
- **DDoS Protections**: WAF, rate limiting, IP blocking on suspicious activity.

## Putting It All Together: Example Flow

1. **User places an order** via the mobile app:  
   - The request hits the **API Gateway** → routes to the **Order Service**.  
   - **Order Service** checks user ID with **User Service** and menu availability with **Restaurant Service**.  
   - If everything is okay, it creates a record in the **Orders DB** and sends a message to the **Payment Service** to handle payment.

2. **Payment** is processed:  
   - Payment gateway response is returned asynchronously via a webhook → Payment Service updates the **Payment DB**.  
   - Payment Service notifies Order Service (via queue or direct API call) that the payment is successful.

3. **Restaurant & Delivery**:  
   - The Order Service notifies the **Restaurant Service** about a new order.  
   - The Delivery Service or a specialized Dispatch Engine finds the nearest delivery executive and assigns the task.  
   - The driver app receives a push notification with order pickup details.

4. **Real-Time Tracking**:  
   - As the delivery executive moves, their app pushes location updates to the Delivery Service.  
   - The Delivery Service can broadcast these updates to the user’s app via **WebSockets**.

5. **Notifications**:  
   - The **Notification Service** sends push notifications or SMS at key steps: order confirmed, out for delivery, etc.

6. **Rating & Feedback**:  
   - Once the order is delivered, user can rate or review the restaurant and driver.  
   - This data is stored in the **Ratings/Reviews** service and fed to the **Analytics** service to improve recommendations.
